    <h2>Amadi Nkechinyere Jennifer</h2>
    <p>My first name is Nkechi and it means "God's gift". I have a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering.
        I have always loved the idea of web design because it brings my creative imagination to reality, that is one of
        the reasons I am studying web design and development. Other reasons are to improve myself, expand my job
        opportunity and so on.</p>
    <P>I am married and hope to expand our little family soon.
        I have been a member of the church all my life and it has brought great blessings to me.</P>
    <p>I love to read novels, gist with loved ones, have fun time and watch movies. It is really a great experience and
        opportunity that I have been granted by BYU Worldwide. I truly appreciate the initiative. It is also a pleasure
        to learn with you all too. Thanks.</p>
